Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm `Mohsen Shabanian`.

As a developer, I mostly self-study. Qbasic and Pascal were my first programming languages. After that, I wrote C and C++ programs for computers and microcontrollers. In recent years, I've developed web applications using C# and PHP.

## Skills :hammer_and_wrench:

* C# :bowtie:
* HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT :smile: 
* C / C++ :smiley:
* PHP :relaxed:
* python :satisfied:
